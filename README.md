# moana-lashes-landing-page
A Landing Page creation to a friend of mine who works as a Eyelashes Designer.

## Description:
I've created this landing page to improve my skills using SEO and Flexbox techniques.

 - [x] About design, I'm currently using Figma. It gives me a lot of creation insights and it allows to see how the website will be done.
 - [x] SEO is the most important technique to increase the searching and traffic to a website.
 - [x] Flexbox is a new way of organizing elements, building a website more responsive.
 - [x] Glassmorphism is new techquine I'm exploring. It gives a glass transparent effect.
